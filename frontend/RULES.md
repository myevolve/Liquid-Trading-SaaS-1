# Project Rules

1. Development Approach:
   - Test incrementally, not all at once
   - Fix mistakes immediately when found
   - Track important details (credentials, column names, function names)
   - Focus on quality and consistency
   - Use best practices

2. Code Management:
   - Regular GitHub commits
   - No unauthorized changes to existing code
   - Modules must not modify core system files
   - Maintain strict separation of concerns

3. Testing Requirements:
   - Test each feature as it's developed
   - Verify functionality before moving to next feature
   - Document test results and fixes

4. Documentation:
   - Keep documentation up-to-date
   - Track all changes and decisions
   - Document credentials and important details

5. Module Development:
   - Follow modular architecture strictly
   - Maintain independence between modules
   - Use API-first approach for integration
   - Support admin configuration without core changes
